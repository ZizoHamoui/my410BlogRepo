              <p class="entry-text">
                This week was all about structure and mechanics. As we moved into the Game Design Document (GDD) phase, I wanted to ensure the team wasn't just working hard, but working safely. When I set the agenda and structure, I intentionally built in a "risk factor", setting our internal deadlines a few days earlier than the actual due date. This buffer proved immediately useful; when the narrative flowboard needed last-minute adjustments, I was able to jump in and refine it without putting us behind schedule.

              <p class="entry-text">
                On the design side, my focus was strictly on defining our "core loop" I wanted mechanics that felt distinct rather than repetitive, so I conceptualized five core pillars and fleshed them out over two pages in the GDD:
                <br>1. <strong>Generate:</strong> Place spark towers to gather resources.
                <br>2. <strong>Deploy:</strong> Deploy stationary towers on tiles.
                <br>3. <strong>Defend:</strong> Defend the scroll from the attacking monsters.
                <br>4. <strong>Clean:</strong> Clean up the ink they left behind.
                <br>5. <strong>Survive:</strong> Make sure the scroll is maintained after all waves are done.
                <br>Once I established this logic, Rakko jumped in to flesh out the specific values for smart depth, which was a great collaborative workflow.

                For the presentation, I assigned slides based on ownership. By having team members present the specific parts they worked on, I noticed everyone felt much more confident and eager to speak.

                Looking ahead, I am shifting back from "Manager" mode to "Developer" mode. I'll admit, I'm feeling a little nervous about the technical workload. It’s been a while since I was in a flow state with Unity, so I’ve blocked out two full days this weekend to just code and resolve that rust.

                Team-wise, the energy is great—everyone has really absorbed the vision and is excited. The only hurdle right now is communication; occasionally the language barrier creates small friction points, but given the team's attitude, I know this is something we can easily overcome.

            <p class="entry-text">
              This week was an intense start to our IAT 410 project, Desk TD, as we prepared for the Greenlight Review. As Project Manager and Lead Programmer, I took the lead on our initial ideation sessions using Figjam to organize our tower-defense concepts.
            </p>
            <p class="entry-text">My primary contribution was drafting our idea for the game proposal and tightening it on FigJam. I spent significant time defining our core mechanics, such as the "Inked Tile" splat system and the "Spark" economy, to ensure our design was both technically feasible. To help my team visualize the project, I created a detailed storyboard on Figjam, which served as a reference for Janis while she designed our stationery characters and refined stroyboards.</p>
            <p class="entry-text">On the management side, I coordinated task distribution and handled the final submission of our documentation. Unfortunately, a sudden bout of food poisoning prevented me from attending the in-person presentation. I had to quickly pivot, delegating my slides on "Mechanics and Justification" to Rakko and Kate to ensure the team was supported during the pitch.</p>
            <p class="entry-text">Looking ahead, I am beginning to set up our Unity environment for us to be able to start working from the next week.</p>
